# Team Profile Generator #

## What it is:

This application is a Team Profile Generator, where a user can input the names of their team Manager, Engineers, and Interns. They will then be prompted to answer several questions about each team member, including their associated email address, Github account username, room number, or school that they attend. When there are no more team members to add, the information will then display in individual stylized cards on an html page.

## How to use:

To start the program, usibg gitbash/the VS integrated terminal, the user can run the following code:

```
node index.html
```

The prompts will then display in order in the terminal, starting with the team manager name input.
